last code of my incomplete mobile application built in react native, pushed for portfolio purposes, note that the backend is also available on the [server repo](https://github.com/freakinu/incomplete-mobile-app-backend/blob/main/index.js)

was a pleasure working on it with [Mr.Zaher Al Attah](mailto:zaher@zdccorp.com)

idea behind it was a group of people sending roasting stickers to each others on the time match is started, plus for surce showing additional informations about matches results & other stuff

was really fun working on it, really enjoyed the [reactnavigation](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/getting-started) library you can use the code with keeping the [license](https://github.com/freakinu/incomplete-hybrid-mobile-app/blob/main/LICENSE) in mind. 
if you're planning on expanding your knowledge in this framework this code might help you a lot.
